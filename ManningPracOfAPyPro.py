# Thoughts on thinking: going over who might be using your software allows you to 
# to identify the qualitites of the software you want to build out.
# (with common aspects like, speed, integrity, resources, security/ emphasis on CIA Triad probably)
# and these can bring out a common outcome like:
# -Loose Coupling: components aren't intricately dependant on one another
# -Intuitability: Developers can develop the nature of the sodtware and how it works by reading it
# -Flexibility: How well developers can adapt the software to relate or similiar tasks
# -Extensibility: Devs can add/change one aspect of the software without affecting other aspects

# Refactoring: the proccess of updating code to reflect your latest/best practices. Difficulty lies in the when should you
# (a good start on the path to making a workflow more robust is to split it's logical steps up) 
# (If each step is handled by it's own service, the service for a particular step only needs to concern...
# itself with one job.)
# ---KISS... break down systems into simplier ones
