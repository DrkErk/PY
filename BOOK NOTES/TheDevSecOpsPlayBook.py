1.1: WHY DEVSECOPS? WHY NOW?
'''

'''
-- The meta for technology engineers was to balance the speed of delivery with security and performance.
   THIS HAS CHANGED WITH DEVSECOPS: because we can now deliver at speed without compromising security, privacy or system performance

-- The Goal of DevSecOps: offer the ability to build reliable, secure, and maintainable products without sacrificing speed to market.
-- This is achieved by (moving away from the older approach of gating) shifting responsibilities earlier in the development pipline
   (That means collaboration to integrate security across technical applications/ services. Utilizing automation and education)
'''

'''
1.2: DevOps OVERVIEW
'''

'''
-- REMINDER: The people/process/technology of DevOps advance the way that engineers will build/deploy/manage technical systems.
          -- This is done by: bridging the gap betweem development and operations teams to get products to market quickly while handling
             the nonfunctional requirements like scalability and stability.

-- DevOps are based on Lean principles and Collabration (VS the common thought that it's about technology/ies.)
   -- Commonly thought of as teh intersection of: (Development, Operations, Quality Assurance)

SUBSECTION: The Three Ways of DevOps
'''

'''
-- The next section is based on the Three ways.

-- The First way: (focuses on the flow through the entire system) 
 - Thinking ReFraming: From, what is my job. To, how do we deliver value to customers.
